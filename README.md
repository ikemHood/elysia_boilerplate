# elysia_starter

my custom Bun-based api starter using ElysiaJS framework, and MongoDB as database.

To install bun and starter packages.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/server.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.35. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
